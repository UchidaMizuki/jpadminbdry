What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
theme_set(theme_void())

for (year in seq(1920, 2010, 30)) {
  plot <- admin_boundary(year) |> 
    ggplot() +
    geom_sf() +
    coord_sf(xlim = c(128, 150),
             ylim = c(30, 46)) +
    labs(title = str_glue("Year: {year}"))
  print(plot)
}
```
